# Automated Playlist Generation

This is a Machine Learning course project.

The task is to create a learning model which will generate playlists from given set of songs. We have used [Jupyter notebooks](notebooks/) as a code base for all sorts of models (logistic regression, KNN, SVM, neural networks) and the results can be seen as well. Currently our best model is a neural network with a 92% accuracy score on the test subset.

Dataset generation requires [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) library.
